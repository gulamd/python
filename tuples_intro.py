# tuple data structure
# tuple can store any data type
# most impt tuples are immutable,once tuple is created you cant update

example = ('one','two','three')
# no append,no insert,no pop,no remove
# where we will use :where we do not need to chnage data
# days = ('mondays')
# tuples are faster than lists
#methods
# count,index
# len fucntion
#slicing print(example[:2])
print(example[:2])
